Convolution is key to deciphering various aspects of signal theory. This concept is often left to its theoretical analysis and analytical perplexity. This is an attempt to illuminate this beautiful concept with some intuitive examples and explanations.

## Introduction

Signals are waves that carry information. Anything that accepts a signal as input and gives an output is a system. In a broad sense, systems allow signals to propagate through them. For example, a wire carrying electrical current is a system. Systems process and transform the signal as it passes through them. Here, for brevity, we will consider systems that have linear behavior and do not change with time. This category of systems is known as Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems. 

Let's consider a familiar scenario—when two people talk, the person speaking generates an input voice signal, and the air channel between the two participants acts as a system.

</figure>

The voice signal flows through the air channel and is received by the listener. The air channel alters the voice signal by adding distortions and noise, i.e., the received voice signal is slightly different from the original one.

</figure>


It is often desired to model and understand the behavior of these systems. The idea is that if we can somehow determine the equation governing the system, it would allow us to evaluate the behavior of the system for different types of signals. We can evaluate the effect of the channel on, say, WiFi signals or Bluetooth signals. Further, this analysis can greatly help engineers in the design of communication systems.

## Impulse Response to Convolution

The evaluation of the equation governing a system might seem a challenging task. Surprisingly, there exists an interesting and simple approach to this problem. It turns out that when a system is provided with an impulse function as input, it produces its equation as output. This response (or output) of the system, measured using an impulse signal, is known as the ***Impulse Response*** of the system. 

$$
\begin{align*}
  & h(t) =  x(t) \ast h(t)\\
  where, \\
  & x(t)=\delta(t) \\
\end{align*}
$$ 

The $$\ast$$ operator is used to denote the convolution operation. And the convolution of an impulse signal $$\delta(t)$$ with system $$h(t)$$ is known as the impulse response. We can think of the impulse function as an arrow to capture the characteristics of a system, which is otherwise not known. 

We can verify this fact in a few lines of Python code:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/ankitk50/bc9daf8d7b3f31cbb5cda7785d04ce92.js"></script>

The output looks like this: 

<figure align="center">
<img src="/blog/assets/impulse_response.jpg" width="800" height="300" alt="impulse response">
<figcaption align="center"  style="font-size:15px" ><em><b>Fig 3:</b> Convolution of an impulse with a system </em></figcaption>
</figure>


Here, the output of the system is given as the convolution of input signal $$h(t)$$ with the system equation. The convolution of signal $$x(t)$$ with system $$h(t)$$ is defined as:

$$
\begin{align*}
  & \phi(t) =  x(t) \ast h(t)\\
  & \phi(t) =  \int_{-\infty}^\infty x(\tau) h(t-\tau)d\tau \\
\end{align*}
$$ 

Under the hood, the operation simplifies to flipping one of the signals and sweeping it across the entire range, evaluating the area of the overlapping region. The two fundamental operations at play are shifting and adding. These two fundamental operations appear in all forms of convolution operations. This is depicted in the following animation from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution).

</figure>

Notice how one signal changes and tries to capture some of the features of the other. The essence of the convolution operation lies in capturing the behavior of the system and applying it to input signals to derive the output signal. Hence, the output signal adopts the characteristics of the system.

## Practical Aspects of Convolution

Convolution is an essential operation in audio signal processing, where the process is used to generate different sound effects in the multimedia industry. Here are two examples from [CKSDE](http://www.cksde.com/) which allow you to listen to the convolution of two different audio samples.

### Example 1.1:

In this example, voice of a man is fed as an input to a system that produces a metallic delay effect.

### Example 1.2:

In this example, audio of a snare drum is fed as an input to a system that produces a decaying white noise.

Apart from this, convolutions also work with images and have immense applications in image recognition, filtering, etc. These are interesting topics which I would cover separately in my future posts.

### Example 2:

Image processing is another domain that witnesses huge application of convolution. Instead of having a signal/system, we have an input image (signal) and an image kernel (system). Images and image kernels are nothing but matrices, with each pixel denoted by a number (or a set of numbers in the case of colored images). The image kernel (also known as filters) is a matrix (usually smaller than your image) used to apply effects on an image such as blurring, sharpening, outlining, etc.

Here as well, the convolution operation involves shifting and adding. The kernel slides over the image, element-wise multiplications are performed with the pixels of the image, and lastly, the sum of these multiplications becomes a pixel of the output/filtered image.

Given below is an example of convolution operation between two matrices:

$$
\begin{align*}
  & \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
      3 & 3 & 2 & 1 & 0 \\
      0 & 0 & 1 & 3 & 1 \\ 
      3 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 \\ 
      2 & 0 & 0 & 2 & 2 \\ 
      2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1
    \end{array} \right)
     \ast
  \left( \begin{array}{c}
      0 & 1 & 2 \\ 
      2 & 2 & 0 \\ 
      0 & 1 & 2 
    \end{array} \right)
  =
    \left( \begin{array}{c}
      12 & 12 & 17 \\ 
      10 & 17 & 19 \\ 
      9 & 6 & 14 
    \end{array} \right)
\end{align*}
$$

</figcaption>
</figure>

This same technique can be applied to images as follows in Python:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/ankitk50/2791a6af15c39b2b8e4c4c4c0c4177bb.js"></script>

Here, we convolved the image with an outline filter: $$\begin{pmatrix}-1 & -1 & -1 \\ -1 & 8 & -1 \\-1 & -1 & -1 \end{pmatrix}$$. 

The output shall generate the following two images:

<figure class="half" style="display:flex">
    <img style="width:300px" src="/blog/assets/cameraman-grayscale.png">
    <img style="width:600px" src="/blog/assets/cameraman_oultine.png">
</figure>
<figcaption align ='center' style="font-size:15px"> <em><b>Fig 6:</b> <b>Left</b>: Input image. <b>Right</b>: Filtered image  </em>
</figcaption>

The behavior of the filter can be understood by observing that the sum of all the elements of the matrix is zero. If the image is smooth, i.e., no changes in color, the convolution output of the filter will be zero. But if there is a sharp change in color gradient (in the case of an edge), the output is non-zero. In this way, the filter is able to achieve the outline of an image.

The convolution operation beautifully scales from the field of signal processing to neural networks. Convolution is at the heart of some of the most complex yet profound applications such as self-driving cars, face recognition used in face unlock, [cancer detection](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/03/assisting-pathologists-in-detecting.html), etc.

</figcaption>
</figure>

These applications are possible using the idea of convolution that explores building deep learning models to classify images and identify objects. This class of deep learning models is known as Convolutional Neural Networks (or [CNN or ConvNets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network)).

CNNs are further being used in [text-to-speech synthesis](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio) to mimic human voice. This [Pictionary](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/) game uses CNN. Make sure you do not miss CNN being used in [autonomous drones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSFYOw4VIYY).
